|Scope, Context, and Background|Online Vehicle Registration Renewal: The conventional methods of renewing vehicle registrations, whether in person or through mail, have become infeasible due to the increasing volume of registrations and the associated information for each vehicle owner. However, The newly implemented RMV online system offers a simplified and streamlined approach to vehicle registration renewal. Prior to their renewal due date, vehicle owners will receive a notification detailing their renewal choices. The online renewal process will entail tasks like verifying vehicle information, reporting any changes, and completing the necessary payment. Additionally, the system will also handle other registration-related functions, including web-based new vehicle registration for dealerships, generating replacement documents, and providing management reporting capabilities.|  -Evan
